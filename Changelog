version 2.3.1.0022:
* Added a 3 lines to catch an edge case in getenumCI2020().

version 2.3.1.0021:
* Fixed a bug in the fix.

version 2.3.1.0020:
* Fixed a bug in the fix.

version 2.3.1.0019:
* Fixed a bug in getenumCI2020() when using 'top=TRUE', 'short.names=TRUE' and a wild card enum (.e.g "action.*.variety").  This would effectively move counts from a top enum to 'Other'.

version 2.3.1.0018:
* Set getenumCI2019 up to accept ci.method = "bootstrap" to help with getenumCI2020 compatibility.

version 2.3.1.0017:
* added 'quietly' argument to getenumCI2020() for scripting.
* changed behavior when top < 1.  Previously, would error.  Now top < 1 displays warning message and sets top to 'NULL' effectively removing 'top'.

version 2.3.1.0016:
* Fixed bug related to some 'by' levels not meeting minimum sample level and some meeting it.  Those that meet it will have method set to 'none' and upper/lower set to NA.  (ci.method can always be set manually to ensure all rows have a confidence interval.)

version 2.3.1.0015:
* Fixed a bug in getenumCI2020() that addresses the hack to avoid the binom.bayes error from 0014.  (All X being either 0 or n caused error.)

version 2.3.1.0014:
* mitigated an error in binom.bayes that manifests itself in getenumCI* when an end (0 or n) exists in x and there are more than 3 rows in the subchunk passed to binom.bayes.
* found an issue with regex control characters in the end of the enum chain.  Mitigated it in getenumCI2019 and getenumCI2020, but it may exist elsewhere.  It has recently become an issue due to the veris 1.3.4 enumerations "asset.cloud.External Cloud Asset(s)" and "asset.cloud.On-Premise Asset(s)".

version 2.3.1.0013:
* more explicit mitigation of enum names issue based on feedback from brms author

version 2.3.1.0012:
* Attempted to mitigate a bug where brms rewrites enum names, making it hard to rejoin the mcmc analysis to the original data.

version 2.3.1.0011:
* Fixed bug where no not_top_enums causes a failure. 
* Also filtered '0's out of top enums so that if the top enums goes town to zero-count enums, they are not shown (except as a '0' for 'Other')

version 2.3.1.0010:
* fixed bug where cred.mass not respected for ci.method="mcmc"

version 2.3.1.0009:
* bug fixes

version 2.3.1.0008:
* some testing of CI changes.
* added MCMC option to CI method - UNTESTED

version 2.3.1.0007:
* initial CI rules changes to enforce sane choices in low sample size situations.  UNTESTED

version 2.3.1.0006:
* Abstracted getenumCI() by year.
* Started on feature updates to getenumCI2020

version 2.3.1.0005:
* Updated getenumCI().

version 2.3.1.0004:
* Updated documentation.

version 2.3.1.0003:
* Fixed historic data.table settings that caused warnings.

version 2.3.1.0002:
* Fixed how victim.industry2.XX is created to ensure only legitimate NAICS codes are created and that all of them are created.

version 2.3.1:
* added ability to specify files directly to json2veris to alleviate performance problems.

version 2.3:
* updated for veris 1.3.3

version 2.2.0.90001.1:
* added 'logical' to the list of column types not reported.

version 2.2.0.90001:
* update to geta4names() to add discovery_method convenience enumerations

version 2.2:  
* updated json2veris() to create a plus.event_chain column as a list of dataframes. each row is the step, and the column is the 4A.

version 2.1:
* updated verisr to work with veris 1.3.1.  Most changes are to json2veris for importing.
* added getenumCI() as a replacement for getenum
* added getenumSRC() as an experimental statistical enumeration tool

verision 2.0:

* added sample data "veris.sample", this will allow quick exploration and samples to function
* foldmatrix: several arguments were changed and removed, will require rework in existing code.
* foldmatrix: enabled seperate variables of "rows" and "cols" to specify the rows and columns of output matrix 
* foldmatrix: rows can be a named list of logical to be used as a filter, or a list of column names of logicals
* foldmatrix: the "clean" variable is now defaulting to TRUE
* getenumlist is removed, the new data.table format allows direct query of columns

Version 2.0.1:

* a few bug fixes, problems with json loading in json2veris() is fixed
* getenum and getenumby() are now one function that are interchangable
* internal `getpattern` function now returns a data table to cbind with core data set, it enables querying for "pattern" in getenum in an easier way.
* getenum with more than one enum (what getenumby() did), now returns a different column name, since the columns are now bound by a "primary" qnd "secondary" limitation the columns are named "enum", "enum1", "enum2" and so on for each enum passed in.

Version 2.0.2:

* minor bug fixes
* Added in 'plota4' function in graphics.R to return ggplot2 object with a4 grid

Version 2.0.3:

* added in 'exclusive' parameter to getenum function.  This will enable a query where an identified Unknown column will return only if exclusive.  As an example, if action.hacking.variety is queried, one record has "SQLi" and "Unknown", and another record has just "Unknown", it will only count the latter (since "Unknown" in the former is not the only exclusive value set in the record).

Version 2.0.4:

* fixed bug in getenum that would error would non-factor column was empty
* minor update to matrix.R and the pattern assignment
* added proc.time() to json2veris (if progressbar==T)

Verison 2.0.5:

* Quick bug fix in getenum()

Version 2.0.6:

* json2veris would silently add columns not in the schema, it now produces a warning
* postproc now replaces NA's in all logical columns with FALSE (related to above)

Version 3.0.0.9003:

* Added 'Embedded' to 'asset.variety' enumeration
* updated getenumCI

Version 3.0.0.9004:

* Added getenumSRC
* updated getenumCI
